  preconference-title: "Supercharging Your Work with Embedded Metadata Workflows"
  abstract: "Metadata is the driving force behind digital file management, but not everyone understands how embedded metadata can be, or should be utilized to help with digital file management. Learn how you can use file-naming conventions and specific tools such as Phil Harvey’s EXIFTool or Python scripts to edit, apply, and manage metadata to large batches of files to facilitate asset discovery down the road. We’ll also take a look at how you can read and write embedded metadata to digital files. These embedded metadata exercises can be used to apply to a number of different goals such as:
 <ul>
 <li> Importing/exporting data to and from various systems (For example, integrating PIM/product information management data with a DAM tool)
 <li> Understanding the provenance of digital asset collections for audit
 <li> Automating metadata application using standardized file-naming conventions
 <li> Embedded Metadata Exercises
 <li> View embedded metadata of digital files
 <li> Edit embedded metadata on digital files
 <li> Export embedded metadata from digital files to a CSV or TXT file

But failure has intrinsic value and is an essential step on the path to professional success. And since it's inevitable, we ought to learn how to face failure, how to talk about it as professionals, and how to grow from it. Fail4Lib, now in its 6th year, is the perennial Code4Lib preconference dedicated to discussing and coming to terms with the failures that we all encounter in our professional lives. It is a safe space for us to explore failure, to talk about our own experiences with failure, and to encourage enlightened risk taking. The goal of Fail4Lib is for participants -- and their organizations -- to get better at failing gracefully, so that when we do fail, we do so in a way that moves us forward. This half-day preconference will consist of case studies, round-table discussions, and, for those interested in sharing, lightning talks on failures we've dealt with in our own work."

  abstract: "Have you been curious about static website generators? Have you been wondering who “Jekyll” and “Hugo” are? Then this workshop is for you!
 <p>
 Static website generators are tools used to build a website made up only of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Static websites, unlike dynamic sites built with tools like Drupal or WordPress, do not use databases or server-side scripting languages. Static websites have a number of benefits over dynamic sites, including reduced security vulnerabilities, simpler long-term maintenance, and easier preservation.
 <p>
 In this hands-on workshop, we’ll start by exploring static website generators, their components, some of the different options available, and their benefits and disadvantages. Then, we’ll work on making our own sites, and for those that would like to, get them online with GitHub pages. Familiarity with HTML, git, and command line basics will be helpful but are not required."

  preconference-title: "Enabling Social Media Research and Archiving"
  abstract: "Social media data represents a tremendous opportunity for memory institutions of all kinds, be they large academic research libraries, or small community archives. Researchers from a broad swath of disciplines have a great deal of interest in working with social media content, but they often lack access to datasets or the technical skills needed to create them. Further, it is clear that social media is already a crucial part of the historical record in areas ranging from events your local community to national elections. But attempts to build archives of social media data are largely nascent. This workshop will be both an introduction to collecting data from the APIs of social media platforms, as well as a discussion of the roles of libraries and archives in that collecting.
 <p>
 Assuming no prior experience, the workshop will begin with an explanation of how APIs operate. We will then focus specifically on the Twitter API, as Twitter is of significant interest to researchers and hosts an important segment of discourse. Through a combination of hands-on and demos, we will gain experience with a number of tools that support collecting social media data (e.g., Twarc, Social Feed Manager, DocNow, Twurl, and TAGS), as well as tools that enable sharing social media datasets (e.g., Hydrator, TweetSets, and the Tweet ID Catalog).
 <p>
 The workshop will then turn to a discussion of how to build a successful program enabling social media collecting at your institution. This might cover a variety of topics including outreach to campus researchers, collection development strategies, the relationship between social media archiving and web archiving, and how to get involved with the social media archiving community. This discussion will be framed by a focus on ethical considerations of social media data, including privacy and responsible data sharing.
 <p>
 Time permitting, we will provide a sampling of some approaches to social media data analysis, including Twarc Utils and Jupyter Notebooks."

  abstract: "Library-generated data related to space utilization, technology utilization, and other primary services can be a main source of insight into the current state of operations. However, if trapped in spreadsheets and on server logs, the data is difficult to evaluate, and often remains unevaluated. Web-based data dashboards provide a platform independent way of incorporating this data into a near realtime visual summary.
 <p>
 In this hands on workshop we will utilize the web framework Angular and the visualization library D3.js to walk participants through the creation of a sample data dashboard application. Benefits of using the Angular framework include reusable components, two-way data binding, and access to command line tools which simplify code generation. D3.js provides a feature-rich library for crafting personalized and modular visualizations.
 <p>
 This sample application will highlight the best of both of these tools. When used together, they create a dynamic, interactive data dashboard that could be used to display a wide variety of relevant institutional metrics. While designed as a brief overview of both of these tools, previous experience with JavaScript would be helpful."

This workshop is geared to anyone that has never used Solr or uses it but has not looked under the hood to see how it can be configured or explored some of the features that Solr offers out of the box.
 <p>
 We'll start the workshop with a quick review on how Solr stores data and the process that it goes when a search is submitted.
 <p>
 We'll then go through a tour of the main features in Solr:
 <ul>
 <li> Indexing: where all of it starts
 <li> How to configure fields for different needs (ever wonder what does the \"_t\" means in a Solr field and how is it different from a \"_s\" field?)
 <li> What are Search Request Handlers
 <li> What do the different parses do (even been puzzled by dismax vs edismax?)
 <li> What's the difference between the \"q\" and \"fq\" parameters when you search
 <li> How to use facets, synonyms, and hit highlighting
 <li> How tweak the ranking of results
 <li> What are local parameters
 <li> How to configure search term suggestions
 <li> How to configure replication (it's easy) and how you can use it
 </ul>
 <p>
 While practical, this workshop does not require you to be a coder. The idea is for you to learn the concepts, features, and how they work. If you choose, we'll show you how to install Solr on your machine to experiment with the concepts as we go. But if you prefer not to install Solr (of updating configuration files is not your thing) you can still follow along and learn with us."
